Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains scripts and resources for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Python. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on movie reviews as our dataset. The sentiment analysis is done using machine learning techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative.

Features
Data Processing: Clean and preprocess movie reviews to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Tokenization: Tokenize reviews into words or phrases for further analysis.
Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning models.
Classification: Use machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify the sentiment of movie reviews.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn
